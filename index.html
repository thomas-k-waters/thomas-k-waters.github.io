				<h2>Hello!</h2>

				<p>My name is Thomas (Korbin) Waters. I am a first-generation Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 
					where I study supermassive black holes and their impacts on their host galaxies.</p>

				<h3>Academic Journey and Inspiration</h3>

				<p>My academic journey in astrophysics started following my service in the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman 
					with the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. I began at South Seattle Community College in Seattle, Washington, 
					initially aspiring to a career in astronautical engineering. However, after attending my first few physics classes, I 
					quickly shifted my focus to astronomy. My professor, Dr. Abigail Daane, was an incredible instructor who deeply inspired 
					me to work towards a career in astronomy. Under her guidance, I received the Ready, Set, Transfer! (RST) Academy 
					scholarship and began a capstone research project on measuring the mass of our local supermassive black hole, 
					Sagittarius A*. As soon as I started the project, I was instantly hooked on research. Moreover, the first time I saw 
					the results, after months of analysis, I was filled with a sense of accomplishment and wonder that I had never 
					experienced before. I knew then that my calling was to be a researcher.</p>

				<h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>

				<p>After obtaining my Associate of Science degree, I transferred to the University of Washington, Seattle, where I majored 
					in astronomy and comprehensive physics. In my first quarter, I joined the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP), 
					a class aimed at introducing students to programming and astronomy research. I was paired with Dr. Meredith Rawls and 
					was introduced to analyzing data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), used as a precursor for the Vera C. Rubin 
					Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This experience was one of the highlights of my undergraduate 
					research as I got my first taste of doing cutting-edge research in astronomy and I gained the foundation of programming 
					skills that have been essential throughout my career. After Pre-MAP, I was fortunate to be accepted to work with Dr. 
					Jessica Werk and her team, called the Werk SQuAD (Student Quasar Absorption Diagnosticians), on projects understanding 
					the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies, and, as an extension to this, I also worked with Dr. Yakov Faerman on 
					the properties of cool CGM. Drs. Werk and Faerman were incredible mentors who taught me the importance of collaboration 
					and the value of a supportive research community.</p>

				<h3>Summer Internships</h3>

				<p>In addition to research at the University of Washington, I attended two summer internships that were pivotal to my 
					development as a researcher. The first was at Caltech in Pasadena, California, where I worked with Kishalay De, then 
					a graduate student but now a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, and his advisor, Dr. Mansi Kasliwal, on a project that 
					aimed to optimize their source detection pipeline for Near-Infrared (NIR) data, which contains the unique challenge 
					of having correlated pixel noise. The second internship I attended was at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for 
					Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I worked with Dr. Razieh Emami to model galactic gas in the IllustrisTNG 
					TNG50 simulation, which resulted in the publication of my first-ever first-author paper. These internships and my 
					research at the University of Washington solidified my passion for research and my desire to pursue a career in academia. 
					I then set my sights on completing my Ph.D.</p>

				<h3>Current Research and Future Aspirations</h3>

				<p>After graduating from the University of Washington, I was accepted into the Ph.D. program at the University of Michigan, 
					Ann Arbor. Here, I work with Dr. Kayhan GÃ¼ltekin. I am currently engaged in a project that aims to measure the mass of a 
					collection of supermassive black holes to expand critical galaxy scaling relations. Details of my ongoing research can be 
					found in the <a href="#research">Research</a> section!</p>

				<p>I am incredibly fortunate to have had unique opportunities and continue to work in a field I am deeply passionate about. I 
					intend to continue my career in astrophysics research, aiming for a postdoctoral position after completing my Ph.D., 
					leading to a research role at an astrophysics research institution. I am also more broadly interested in data science and 
					scientific computing. I intend to complete the University of Michigan's Data Science Certificate program to gain a more 
					robust foundation in data science and scientific computing to complement my research skills.</p>

				<h3>A Personal Note</h3>

				<p>Outside of research, I love spending time in nature. My favorite activity is rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors, 
					but I also enjoy hiking, camping, and backpacking. I enjoy running, biking, and swimming less so, but I am currently 
					training for a triathlon! I am trying to make an effort to stay in shape by, of course, choosing to do something 
					incredibly difficult (the story of my life!). I also have a plethora of hobbies, including playing the guitar, creating 
					stained glass, reading books (Stephen King and J.R.R. Tolkien are my favorites), and playing video games. I am a huge fan 
					of RPGs and any game that has a compelling story. I try to give myself the time to relax, do things that I enjoy, and 
					spend time with the people I love. I think this is essential to being a good researcher!</p>

				<h3>Get in Touch</h3>

				<p>I am always open to collaborative opportunities and discussions about astrophysics. Feel free to reach out to me via the 
					contact form linked in my <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section. There, you will also find links to my LinkedIn, ORCID, 
					GitHub, and a search on NASA ADS for my publications. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
